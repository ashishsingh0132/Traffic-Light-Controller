# Traffic-Light-Controller

The .vhd file contains VHDL code for a Traffic Light Controller.
The code describes the logic for controlling the state transitions and output signals corresponding to the green, yellow, and red lights of the traffic light system.

A clock divider circuit generates a 1 Hz signal from a 50 MHz clock, facilitating state transitions in digital systems. This 1 Hz signal serves as a timing reference for synchronizing operations and controlling state changes within the system.

 State logic determines the behavior of each phase, controlling the outputs based on the present state and adjusting delays accordingly.
